Social code, Anna
"I hate this place" I heard the voice of Alex who'd suddenly found himself right next to me (although most likely he had actually been there all along, just without me noticing) "You wanna go for a smoke? Sometimes we go in the backyard, to smoke," he waved his hand, pointing at an opened window, which, because we were at the ground floor, could be used as a door leading towards the yard - a gesture that, although delivered with a quite plain and emotionless tone of voice stroke me as most flattering, not only because inviting me with him, meant that he believed me to be better than the rest of the people in the room, a more worthy company etc, but more importantly he saw me as all that without knowing almost anything about me, a fact that I actually found irreconcilable with the way I imagined that social code worked in general - in my mind each social circle or clique had a certain set of principles, like the principle of competitiveness in my school, which I sometimes saw as the axioms of a formal system, and some criteria for acceptance for its members that were derived from these principles not only provided control over who had access to the group, but more importantly created a social context for the conversations that were to take place there. Inviting random people to a group meant that it did not adhere to such principles, which in turn meant that there everything was possible in terms of social context (just like in logic everything can follow from falsehood). The invite, in that respect was a *carte blanche* for me to act in whatever way I decided and be whoever I pleased. And not only that, but it constituted the encouragement to do so. With it, Alex was saying that he not only liked me, but he would potentially like any of the people that could be living in my brain, which were, otherwise, completely different, save for the fact that all of them liked slipping annoying math metaphors into any innocent train of thought (and also all of them would have like that joke as well, I think).

I took Alex's hand (he was helping me go through the window) and then I turned around and saw that the girl who I talked to a few minutes ago was right behind me, this was the one who looked somewhat reluctant to talk to me, after we exchanged a few initial words, but at that time her enthusiasm had returned and she was laving at me. After I was out, Alex reached out to help her, but she ignored his hand and jumped from the window herself in a very clumsy manner, almost hitting me and almost falling off her feet in the process. Later, when I would get very close, even intimately close with this girl (Anna) I would understand that she ignored Alex's help mainly because of the self-esteem issues, but then it seemed to me that she was just being snobbishly-individualistic (which was often the same thing but at that time I didn't know *that* as well) and so I was immediately drawn to her, albeit partially unsuccessful, attempt to show us that we are useless and herself - independent. 

While Anna was still getting up and fixing her dress, Alex rushed towards the fence and left me alone with her. The noises from the room had almost completely fainted when we exited the building, resulting in a silence which was making me uneasy, but which, due to my despise for small talk, I didn't know how to break without making the situation even more uncomfortable, "So what are you in for?" I heard Anna's question which, if I were sat, would have made me jump from my chair, but was at the same time it was exactly the kind of thing that I would have asked her if I weren't afraid she would consider it completely inappropriate, "I was caught with a few marijuana cigarettes," I told her the short version, "And you?", but instead of answering she just waved her hand in an ironic gesture that was very customary to her and told me something like "You know, the usual stuff," in a tone of voice that almost made me uncomfortable that I don't know what the usual stuff is, but at the same time angered me, like all those math textbooks and white papers that would introduce a theorem or some other kind of result without giving any kind of reference, whose authors I'd always considered full of shit, regardless if they refraining from citing their sources out of laziness, or out of some desire to show us that they are so smart and educated, that for them stuff like this is so obvious that it goes without saying. I initially, meant to show my annoyance by just ending the conversation, as I usually do, but the reverse idea also came to mind, as if coming from some shadowy alter ego of mine who (the alter ego) also took over my decision process and proceeded to act on my behalf - "Sorry, what's that 'usual stuff'?" I said, with a tone that didn't sound a least bit apologetic. "You are very handsome," her response/reaction was weird, and it left me overwhelmed, so much as to even consider whether she did it just to close my mouth to prevent me from asking about what did she do, but the possibility that she was playing didn't even matter that much to me, as, even if I hadn't mentioned it by now, Anna was pretty too - clothes, hair, makeup, body silhouette had all been accounted, as well as the mannerisms without which one could not be considered (even with  all of the above factors) truly female.
