Bonding by not-bounding/The uncut book pages/overthinkers

At first I thought Anna was going to make *me* disappear from her world as well, as soon as I made a mistake or two, like for example in the beginning of the evening when I tried to talk to her about my favorite movies (a topic that I always brought up when I had nothing else to talk about) or shortly after, when she talked me about her relationship with her parents - my initial reaction then was to try to make some weird parallel between it and the relationship that *I* had with my parents and to try to resolve her issues by means of it, not because I really believed I can do it (my relation with my parents wasn't that good anyways), but because I thought that that were the only useful direction to which I could take this conversation. In hindsight, I was obviously way off, not realizing that all my solutions were to her just new problems, that every advice was criticism, and that every attempt to get close to her actually bought me farther away. 

But although she never made any compromise with her rejection to be involved in any of those topics, she also forgave me for bringing them up, and waited very patiently for me to correct my mistakes like a strict teacher who nevertheless really likes for their students to succeed, and she kept guiding me towards the direction she wanted me to head towards, which interestingly was the complete opposite of the one I thought that I should go - I figured that what we should be doing some bonding, you know, sharing our life stories and finding some common ground between us through them, really she seemed to want to escape from the aforementioned stories like from a bad dream, and she absolutely didn't want me to have anything to do with them. She didn't want me in her castle, neither she wanted to get to mine (weird methaphor, but bear with me), but wanted us both to stay outside of ourselves, with our conversations roaming freely from subject to subject without being restrained by our personas.

However, that was harder than I thought as there were only as much that you can say about a given subject without going to the realm of the personal, and moreover our (at least mine) attempts to escape from ourselves had this weird quality that, the more you concentrate on being objective and detached, the more revealing you actually can be to the trained eye, for example, I feel that a person who has heard me talk about math knows more about me than any person with whom I just had some mundane conversations. That must have something to do with the fact that each system of knowledge is based on some self-evident postulates, and so the more fundamental an assertion is, the closer it is to a postulate i.e. by saying things that we find self-evident we actually expose our core beliefs (and we get nose bleeds). If you talk with me about math, I would tell you that we have to remain optimistic about finding the solution about such and such problem, that computer-generated proofs are a good technology, but they take away the human aspect from the discipline which still should be central, and then I'd start telling you about some ideas that I had the previous day. This all probably makes me an idealist, and the way Ann reacted to it, I think, makes her an idealist too, as she listened without making weird and vaguely related remarks that were meant as an excuse to change the subject and when she did change the subject, she did it in a way that was sudden but at the same time didn't feel forced - she started talking about books, but ignored usual topics of favourite genres and authors, and instead talked about why she preferred paper books (the way that paper smells), the times of the day (and night) when she readed etc. Then she started telling me a story of how she got a very old and rare novel (she didn't say the title) from her local library, and when she read till about halfway through it, she came across two pages that weren't cut out properly, which made her realize that although many people had lended the novel previously, she was the first one to reach that point. In the end, she felt hesitant to split the paper, and ended up leaving the pages sealed as she found them. I didn't ask her why, as I knew that she would ask me why should she cut it in return, and went on to pounder whether there was a chance that some other person had gotten till those pages before, but they were also hesitant cut it, and I suddenly recalled an occurence when I came accross a pair of impoperly-cut pages myself - the book was mine, so I did cut them (or tear them by hand, which seems more probable), but I *did* feel an awkward sensation when I saw the concealed page for the first time - it was like I was seeing something that I was not permitted to see. 

Because, after all, who gave me the right to do it, and who would even be capable of giving me such right (some obscure Greek god maybe? ;DDDD). That was one of those questions that don't make any sense before someone asks them, but once they are on the table, they can make me confused as hell, a reaction that perhaps makes me worse than Ann, who just felt that same sensation, but she quickly skipped the pages instead of overthinking the hell out of it, like I am doing. Or perhaps both of us are lucky, because we are not numb at this weird sensation, and because we can probably perceive countless other similar phenomena that don't exist for other people. But then again perhaps we were crazy for having minds that stop and start all the time when they want like and old car. 



Feelings cause confusion, while sex, on the other hand, clears it out.

But there was no real issue with us sleeping together. Stupid thoughts like "but am I the person who is appropriate to be her first lover"

"Do you want to see Dana?" she asked me after a while (Dana was the nickname she used for that dirty profile in that social network that she told me about)...
