At first I thought Anna was going to make *me* disappear from her world as well, as soon as I made a mistake or two, like for example in the beginning of the evening when I tried to talk to her about my favorite movies (a topic that I always brought up when I had nothing else to talk about) or shortly after, when she talked me about her relationship with her parents - my initial reaction then was to try to make some weird parallel between it and the relationship that *I* had with my parents and to try to resolve her issues by means of it, not because I really believed I can do it (my relation with my parents wasn't that good anyways), but because I thought that that were the only useful direction to which I could take this conversation. In hindsight, I was obviously way off, not realizing that all my solutions were to her just new problems, that every advice was criticism, and that every attempt to get close to her actually bought me farther away. 

But although she never made any compromise with her rejection to be involved in any of those topics, she also forgave me for bringing them up, and waited very patiently for me to correct my mistakes like a strict teacher who nevertheless really likes for their students to succeed, and she kept guiding me towards the direction she wanted me to head towards, which interestingly was the complete opposite of the one I thought that I should go - I figured that what we should be doing was sharing our life stories and finding some common ground between us through them, really she seemed to want to escape from the aforementioned stories like from a bad dream, and she absolutely didn't want me to have anything to do with them. She didn't want me in her castle, neither she wanted to get to mine (weird methaphor, but bear with me), but wanted us both to stay outside of ourselves, with our conversations roaming freely from subject to subject without being restrained by our personas.

However, that was harder than I thought as there were only as much that you can say about a given subject, without going to the realm of the personal, and moreover our (at least mine) attempts to escape from ourselves had this weird quality that, the more you concentrate on being objective and detached, the more revealing you actually can be, to the trained eye, for example, I feel that a person who has heard me talk about math knows more about me than any person with whom I had mundane conversations. The axiomatic nature or knowledge has been well documented - if each system is necessarily based on some self-evident postulates, then the more fundamental an assertion is, the closer it is to a postulate i.e. by saying things that we find self-evident we actually expose our core beliefs (and we get nose bleeds).

But there was no real issue with us sleeping together. Stupid thoughts like "but am I the person who is appropriate to be her first lover"

"Do you want to see Dana?" she asked me after a while (Dana was the nickname she used for that dirty profile in that social network that she told me about)...
