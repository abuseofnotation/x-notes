At first I thought Anna was going to make *me* disappear from her world as well, as soon as I made a mistake or two, like for example in the beginning of the evening when I tried to talk to her about my favorite movies (a topic that I always brought up when I had nothing else to talk about), or shortly after, when she talked me about her relationship with her parents - my initial reaction then was to try to make some weird parallel between me and her and the relationship that I had with my parents and to try to resolve her issues, not because I really believed I can do it (my relation with them wasn't that good anyways), but because I thought that that were the only direction that would make this conversation useful. In hindsight I was obviously way off as I didn't realize that every advice that to her every solution created a problem, that every advice was criticism, and every time I tried to get close to her, I'd actually get farther away. But although she never made any compromise with her rejection to be involved in any of those topics, she also forgave me for bringing up all them, and waited very patiently for me to correct my mistakes, like a teacher who really likes for hes students to succeed.


In the next hour, we spend hugging and laughing. It was beautiful, but very stale - having destroyed a whole world between us, we stayed together beautiful and fearless, but there was nothing that any of us wanted to say to the other person.

But there was no real issue with us sleeping together. Stupid thoughts like "but am I the person who is appropriate to be her first lover"


"Do you want to see Dana?" she asked me after a while (Dana was the nickname she used for that dirty profile in that social network that she told me about)...
