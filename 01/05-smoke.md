Outside, Reality changing

Anna went immediately to Alex without ever paying attention to her friend who were sitting right in his lap "I need a cigarette!" she said, disregarding, or even enjoying the fact that Catherina would have to stand from her comfortable position at the lap of her boyfriend in order for him to pull out his pack, and when went on shouting and waving her hands, making me feel at loss when I remembered our previous, very pleasant conversation. There was something very theatrical in her gesture, and it seemed like she was doing it regularly judging from the way in which Alex immediately proceeded to give her what she wanted while Catherina just ignored her on her own right with a grimace that showed boredom and turned to me instead, "Ah, Alex, you brought a friend, nice," she said and then asked me for my name, at which point I decided to tell them the story about how I was grounded for painting my name on my room's door when I was little and how I then made it to one big "X" sign. "Nice story, but 'X', that sounds a bit lame, overloaded, I'd say," Catherina said when she heard the ending, but before I had time to clarify that my point wasn't to adopt the letter as a nickname Anna entered the conversation: "You have no taste, it's awesome!" with which, although she said it just to annoy her friend, cemented this nickname for a long time.

We went on gossiping and drinking the whiskey that Catherina had brough and Anna went on insisting (although neither Alex nor Catherina seemed to share her centiment) how awful everything in the facility was and how she wanted to get away from it, until neither them, nor even myself could stand listening to her any more, a fact which I, at some point, decided to express by standing up, pointing to a whole in the fence right next to us, which I had noticed earlier, and saying "Fine, let's go." This act left everyone in silence, making it apparent that none did get the joke. "Yeah, very funny, but I don't want to have a private spanking session with Stella," Anna responded, but then Catherina cut her in a way analogous to the one in which Anna had cut Caterina a couple of minutes ago,"Why, what is she to do, kick us out?" and then she elaborated, explaining that the huge taxes that her parents pay for us made either our exclusion, or any form of severe punishment highly unlikely and she went on to elaborate that this was the main reason why the private education was at the state that it was while she was finishing up Alex's bottle of alcohol, "The issue is that the quality of education is not all that important for economic growth, especially amongst the upper class. In capitalism such institutions are marginalized. Up to a point where they exist only because of tradition," she stayed silent for a minute and then she appeared to remember what triggered her monologue and stood up from the bench, "So we can't get punished. Let's make use of this privilege, it is one of the few ones that we have!" she stood up and crossed the fence. Anna seemed devastated at first, not only by the way in which Catherina had cut her, but by the fact that she had to break the rules to remain with her. Later I would learn that Ann, although seemingly detached from reality actually felt a very strong need to identify with someone else from it, a need that was probably unexplicable to her as it was to us. 

I asked Catherina about what she meant by saying that not being punished is one of the few privileges that she had, as I already knew she was super wealthy by that time, and she became very introspectic, "Well, being part of the upper class has its privileges, obviously, but you only get them if stay in it, for which you must adjust every aspect of your lifestyle - maybe you adjust it for the better, but still it is done against your will. Like, imagine that you are stuck in a very beautiful place, but one which is covered from all sides with fences, up to a point where it feels like a prison and if you view it like this you have almost no priviliges save for the fact that whenever you see a hole in the fence you are free to escape for a little, before they find it out and patch it up." I liked the way she explained it." I didn't respond anything to her (probably because she only left me a little time before she stuck her tongue in Alex's mouth), but I was impressed by the way she explained to me (simply and without showing off), and thought that she really knew where I was coming from when asking the question, and it felt really good to "touch thoughts" with someone, albeit just for a second (it never happens for much longer anyways). 

"So let's go," Catherina said and we all went, breaking the exit rule, each for their own reasons: Catherina, because in her own words that breaking rules and not getting punished was the only privilege she had. Anna, because she prefered to trash her principles than to have them, but not to have somebody to share them with. Alex, because he probably had no concept of rules at all, or if he had, it was quite different than ours. And me, because a few minutes later I had remembered a silly childhood memory in which I broke the rules for no reason at all and which I wanted to understand/recreate.

While I was crossing the border, I remembered a thought that I had a few weeks ago, related to the difference between discreet and continuous mathematical models. Ever since I read proposition one of Newton's "Principia..." where in order to be able to compute the influence of continuous forces, the author imagined that these forces are not in fact continuous but operate on discreet bursts, alternating between each other (this is the idea behind calculus, basically), I had this weird idea that the world is continuous and that discreet events and quantities are actually just some abstractions that we invented to make sense of it. Taken to a higher level this would mean that when thinking myself going through that fence is not an event or decision that happened at a specific point in time, but rather a long process with no specific beginning and end (and that the event of crossing the fence just represented the time when *my mind* understood what's actually happening). I liked this theory, because it confirmed my sispicion that our understanding of the world is flawed and fragmented, and that we can only gain some deeper insight about what's really happening through some very sublime form of intuition.

As we continued walking through the woods 


"Look, I understand why you like her, you are both a bit off, so maybe you would go well together" was his response, but I didn't find it quite usefull - from mathematics I have learned that we too often tend to group things that we don't understand into very broad categories, that don't have any equivalence in the real world.
