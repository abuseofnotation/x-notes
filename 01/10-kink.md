Kids and older people/Being good/

I went to Anna's room and we talked a bit, but she seemed distant, like she was copying Cathy's way of reacting to everything, trying to be witty for no reason and being at the same time shy and over the top with her movements. While I went to my room to pick up my stuff she had put on a very short nightgown, but she seemed to be very uncomfortable in it, which made me uncomfortable as well, and she kept taking on impersonal conversations, saying things like "You will meet Jane tomorrow, she is very sweet, a very good person actually," as she was pulling her blanket to cover her chest. Watching her, I kept thinking that that was the "real" Anna which I was seeing when Catherina was gone and, I suspect, *because* she was gone - she looked innocent and confused, her posture was not offensive but defensive and, above all, she was extremely well-tempered, even stupidly so, more than anyone in her social surroundings would ever appreciate - her behaviour was that of a kid, of someone who was never disappointed, almost like someone who cannot be disappointed. 

A little remark that she made that sounded similar to something I myself used to say made me want to remember how I felt when I was like her - as a kid (my childhood lasted longer than that of most other people) and I was putting a lot of effort to be good to everyone, and to fill the mold (or perhaps the cage) that their expectations consisted of, and I was not giving up for a long time, simply because I didn't know that giving up was an option. I treated the feedback from older people around me (teachers, parents etc) as the only form of validation that existed and them, as the only people who knew what it was to be good. But they were not, and realizing that also made me realize why my efforts to be better were never enough for them, and why they always had their remarks regarding my behaviour, most of which were less than favourable no matter how hard I tried - it was because they themselves didn't have the answers, it was because there were no answers and even if there were some, they weren't to be found in the collective conscience that they were representatives of, but were instead personal and perhaps even intimate, as the answers I found in mathematics, or those I felt when I talked to people about, usually, quite different things - in short, they weren't provoked by criticism, but by acceptance of what the other people think. Realizing this helped me realize that it wasn't just that the people who criticize you that are never going to be satisfied (something that every child realizes) but that *I* too woudn't feel satisfied by following their advice (something too few people realize AFAIK) and that the only thing that being succeptable to criticism would do for you is to turn you into a critic yourself, in the same way in which my first reaction to seeing Anna's naivity was to tell her that she was being too childish and that she needs to grow up and stuff. 

But fortunately I stopped myself on time and never said any of the, at present, awful-sounding things that she had probably heard too many times, nor I looked her in a weird way

not to praise her but to adore her, not to tell her that she is correct, but to tell her that she is super. 

And a clear soul like hers was easy to adore.
