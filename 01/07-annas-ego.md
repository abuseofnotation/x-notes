Anna's kinky alter ego

While we were walking back to the facility Alex and Catherine called me and asked me if I wanted to sleep in Catherine and Anna's room with Anna, so they can sleep together with. The rooms were next to each other, so it wouldn't be a big deal. I refused, saying that I don't want to sleep in someone else's bed. "Fine, then Anna would go to sleep on Alex's bed," Catherine said. I said that it was fine by me, as I didn't think that Anna would be OK, but to my surprise she agreed immediately. 

After the arrangement was made, Alex and Catherine resumed their private conversation and left me and Anna alone, and so we continued our talk from before, she asked me again about what I was in for (using the same expression that before I thought of as a joke) and about the marijuana cigarettes, but I insisted that she tell me first, which she tried to do but could not, or at least I wasn't sure what to make of her story: apparently she had gotten bored one evening so she had created an anonymous profile on some social network which I haven't heard of and had created, in her own words, "a totally different personality" for herself that, the way I understood it, was defined mainly by her extreme sexual promiscuity (while the real Anna, she told me, actually never had sex). The initial idea was to do some "exploratory communication", that is, to chat about things that she didn't normally talk about with her friends, or in a way that she wouldn't do it normally, but she gradually came about from chatting about all kinds of stuff to only talk with people about their sexual experiences and then about her made up sex life (picking older married guys at sport pubs and fucking them at parks at night, having group sex, posting an ad for an escort service etc). With that, her kinky alter ego started, in her own words, "leaking into her real life" - she had started exchanging real nude pics of herself (for which she had to start, for the first time, maintain her intimate parts), she began searching for sex partners on the Internet, a search which was by definition fruitless, as when the time for a real-life encounter came she would make up all kinds of excuses and stop talking with the man or woman whom she was hitting on, but which felt more and more exciting nevertheless, as this abandonment came at a later and later stage every time, with the and the final one (although never happening) felt more and more real with each encounter. This resulted in her sharing more and more of her personal details with people (pics of her face, links to some of her "vanilla" social media profiles) and ultimately in one of her "partners" crossing the border, that story she left untold, and instead only mentioned that her parents had discovered her anonymous profiles and after that had sent her here immediately.

Like I said, I didn't know what to make of her story as, I felt, she herself didn't, which gave me the eerie impression that some of it was fake not so much in its factual aspect, but in the way that she expressed it in terms of her own motivation - the little she said about why she did what she did was along the lines of "I was horny" which, I thought, felt really insincere, so I asked her "Why didn't you just have sex with someone?" in my attempt to provoke her, and her response left me even more baffled - she said  "I don't know, I have never thought about it," and then went on to talk about how her parents would never let her have a boyfriend (as if they *did* approve her hitting on random people on the Internet) and how they trying to restrict her about everything. The way she talked left me with the impression that some of these restrictions were internalized, that is, they had been slammed in her head for so long that in her mind, that they formed a layer that was below the layer of things that she wouldn't do for fear of being punished, - one that consisted of things that she would just *never ever even think about doing*, even if there wasn't anyone watching her. The fact that sex was one of these things made it even weirder for me, since I also considered myself sexually repressed (at school we used to joke that sex was invented as a consolation for people who can't factor quadratic equations, but we all knew that the reality of it was that jokes at this one were invented as a consolation for mathematicians who don't and can't have enough sex (there were other jokes from this series, like the one about whether mathematicians prefer a wife or a lover, but I spare you, as this is a very serious book.)). But I guess there was much difference in the way we perceive things that we consider forbidden and things that are just taboo, the former constituting joke material, and the latter bringing drug-like satisfaction to some people, when brought up.
