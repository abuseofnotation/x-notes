The loneliness of the non-conformist

Anna's childish behavior/Irony/war metaphors

I went to Anna's room and we talked a bit, but she seemed distant, like she was copying Cathy's way of reacting to everything, trying to be witty for no reason and being at the same time shy and over the top with her movements. While I went to my room to pick up my stuff she had put on a very short nightgown, but she seemed to be very uncomfortable in it, constantly pulling the blanket to cover her chest, while taking on impersonal conversations, saying things like "You will meet Jane tomorrow, she is very sweet, a very good person actually." Watching her, I kept thinking that that was the "real" Anna which I was seeing, when Catherine was gone and, I suspect, *because* she was gone - she looked innocent and confused, her posture was not offensive but defensive and, above all, she was extremely well-tempered, even stupidly so, more than Catherine or anyone in her social circle would ever care appreciate - her behavior was that of a kid, of someone who was never disappointed, almost like someone who to some extend cannot be disappointed. It's always strange when someone turns out to be sweet and good when the social masks are off, at first the revelation seems almost scarier than people who are fucking psychopaths underneath, but this occurrence is only natural if you think about it - who has bigger need to wear a mask than a gentle little thing like her.

A little remark that she made that sounded similar to something I myself used to say made me want to remember how I felt when I was like her - as a kid (my childhood lasted longer than that of most other people) and I was putting a lot of effort to be good to everyone, and to fill the mold (or perhaps the cage) that their expectations consisted of, and I was not giving up for a long time, simply because I didn't know that giving up was an option. I treated the feedback from older people around me (teachers, parents etc) as the only form of validation that existed, and them, as the only people who knew what it was to be good. But they were not, and realizing that also made me realize why my efforts to be better were never enough for them, and why they always had their remarks regarding my behavior, most of which were less than favorable no matter how hard I tried - it was because they themselves didn't have the answers regarding what it was to be good, it was because there were no answers and even if there were some, they weren't to be found in the collective conscience that they (older people) were representatives of, but were instead personal and perhaps even intimate, as the answers I found in mathematics, or those I felt when I talked to people about, usually, quite different things. In short, they weren't provoked by criticism, but by acceptance of how the other person thinks and feels. And realizing this helped me realize that it wasn't just that the people who criticized me that are never going to be satisfied (something that every child realizes, sooner or later) but that *I* too wouldn't feel satisfied by following their advice (something too few people realize AFAIK). That the only thing that being susceptible to criticism would do for you is to turn you into a critic yourself, and to make you grumpy (for a lack of a better word). Because when you think about it, what critics do is trying to redefine reality so it works in their favor and that's a lost cause for many reasons: One - reality cannot be redefined so easy (even when we are talking about the reality of just your family or your social circle). And two, even convincing everyone that they should think like you, wouldn't make it *really* so e.g. people who are unhappy with this way of thinking would still be unhappy and all that you would be achieving is shutting down their chance to be fulfilled. Besides, even the most successful critics are still just critics, that is, they just interpret the worldviews of other people (most of which probably didn't feel a particular need to be criticized). 

But still we all judge everyone else around us, even though we know it's stupid, simply because we are built like that. Even (and I'm really ashamed to confess it) *my* first reaction to seeing Anna's naivety, which I luckily managed to suppress, was to tell her that she was being too childish and that she needs to grow up and stuff. Not only was I about to judge her, but I was about to criticize her for her immaturity and criticizing someone for being immature is the worst type of criticism there is, as with it you are basically saying that they are not as huge of a critic as you (or that they have too much desire for happiness perhaps?) I have this theory (which I am sure you were dying to hear) that the criteria for maturity in a given society is not based on any kind of physical or emotional strength but on *obedience* and on the ability to put up with everything that you need to put up with. Like, for example we don't call "mature" a kid that plays chess at professional tournaments (and neither a young mathematician who is trying to solve the Knapsack problem, mind you), we keep that label for the child who is unremarkable in the special way that is not causing us any kind of concern. From this theory it follows that human societies are basically useless and wasteful machines for creating boring robots, but that is another story.

Luckily, I was able to detect the "boring robot" behavior on time so I managed to stop myself on time and never said any of those at hindsight awful-sounding things that Anna had probably heard too many times (one is already too many), nor did I go at the equally easy-to-fall-into opposite direction of trying to be the "anti-critic", telling her that it was *her* behavior and her worldview that was the right one and that everyone who criticize her are better off imitating her. No, I might have not known any better in terms of how to free her mind from the cage that being susceptible to criticism has put her into, but I knew enough to know that I couldn't do that by just attacking the people who attacked her and in the same way that they attacked her. I knew that she didn't need me to praise her but to adore her, didn't need to be told that she is correct, but to be told that she is super, that she is OK.

And a clear soul like her's was easy to adore. This was kind of paradoxical as she wasn't the kind of person who somebody would typically *choose* to adore, nor one who would even *know* how to be adored at any of the ways that were existed in this world. But once she got tired of those clumsy mannerisms with which she welcomed me (and at which she was so terribly bad at anyways) and saw that I wasn't being impressed by them as well, she quickly stripped them down from herself like a little girl stripping away her mother's old ball gown that she had to wear at a formal event (and who possibly is already wearing sneakers underneath it) and presented herself in a way that was free of melancholy and of the irony that results from it, a self for which adoration was almost the only feeling that I could or needed to feel.

When I say free of irony, I feel I need to elaborate, as I already mentioned Anna *was* ironic, however her irony was of type which was quite different from the emotion-numbing type you usually see in other people. It was an irony that had no concrete subject, nor an audience that was supposed to "get it" and laugh, a general irony, one which was targeted at everything with the purpose of being appreciated by everyone (although not many people actually did), one which seemed to perpetuate the natural asymmetry of the world and the general irrelevance of most of the things that we say and think. Her usage of this irony was so pervasive that it looked like the whole her individuality (the real one, not the clumsy imitation of Cathy that she presented to the world) existed solemnly within its bounds - her irony provided for her a safe place that enabled her individuality to flourish, but it was also a shield that guarded her from the rest of the world. In its realm, she could be really beautiful and confident and could walk naked and vulnerable without any fear of being hurt, but at the same time she was lonely, like a princess in a castle, spending some of the time secretly hoping that she would get kidnapped.

There was a concrete hand gesture, that Anna did all the time and which, I think embodied what I am talking about - it was a weird combination of a slapping movement (the movement when you make when you want somebody to stop something) and of hand-waving and she used it to express a feeling that was a combination of boredom ("yeah, yeah, we have heard about that already") and of supreme disinterest (like she wanted to say "There would be nothing you can possibly say about that that would in any way intrigue me") and whenever she thought a given topic or line of thought was not worthy of her attention, she just did that gesture and then just stopped listening to what I was saying until I changed the subject - it was something like a magical move, which made the thing that she didn't like disappear from her world, and made me disappear myself as a punishment for failing to recognize the nature of her magical abilities - I was still there and she was still with me, however after a while I felt that I was with Anna the impostor and that Anna the princess had banished me from the castle.

This ability of hers had always made me furious, as probably every peasant was furious at the aristocrats for being what they are and not simple and easy to understand like themselves (or indeed any person who saw people with more power than them), so I spent a lot of effort to make her more like me, make her face the unpleasant circumstances around us, even without accepting them, as acceptance was a quality that I myself didn't possess. In my mind I had thought that I would be doing her a favor by making her face her fears which I resembled the ones that I had at my childhood when I was afraid to go out of bed because some monsters will eat me (perhaps the "X" drawing on my door was some subconscious ritual that would protect me from them), but no - Anna was actually much more mature then what I thought and the fears that she had that made her negate everything were actually pretty real - she feared the people's hatred and intolerance, especially towards woman and minorities, groups both of which she represented. She feared "the Dull" as she called it, (which I maintain is not real but invented, but that doesn't make it any less scary) and that she would little by little be sucked into it - a very real possibility which would also turn out to be the fate of many of our friends, as the days went by. In many ways she was a realist and she wasn't so much in fear of those things, as she was foreseeing and mitigating the issues that they might have caused to her - when a war is coming, among the people who are getting ready to fight and those who are scared that they would have to, there would  always those some who had long fled out of the country, leaving everything behind them (under a fake name if needed) and were watching the action from the other part of the world from behind a pair of big sunglasses. None of them would go in history, but they also wouldn't have to participate in the absurd events that it was comprised of (if history weren't absurd, there wouldn't be a whole scientific discipline dedicated to decyphering how and why the hell did some events happen). 

I was the opposite: I was always fighting, although my bravery was phony - if I were a soldier, I wouldn't be like those truly brave ones who enter the battle with a devotion to die for their ideals - I probably would have been more akin to a guy those whose bravery, if it were present at all, is gone after the first gunshot, the one who is always looking back towards retreat and the only reason he is not heading to that direction is that he knows that they will likely shoot him as a deserter, while if he goes forward he would die as a hero which *seems* a little better. He would go into battle, he might even be able to maintain concentration and do better than some soldiers who are truly brave due to his ability to detach himself when faced with a scary situation, but no matter how far he gets, everyone would know that his bravery is a result of cowardice - he is only advancing because he is too scared to escape.

Or perhaps the issue is that I didn't have anywhere to retreat *to*, that I stayed in the trenches, like for example many of my classmates who like me were able to retreate to mathematics when they were facing issues with some other aspect of their life, but who also, unlike me, were able to sink so deep into the subject that they would forget everything else in much the same way in which dedicated soldiers would sink into the idea of winning *their* war, whatever it was. Sometimes I envied those people - in my mind they were always happier than me - as no matter what choice did I make, I would always be unsure about it, and looking forward for an oportunity to change it, even for a second, not so much because I regret the choice itself, but because I dislike *the fact that I have to make it* - something which Anna realised too, and because of which she never attempted to escape from her escapism - that the problem was in our mind and it was precisely there where it could be solved.
