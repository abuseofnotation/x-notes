Perverted virgin

When she came back she had a transparent blouse that from which her nipples were clearly visible and the short miniskirt with panties of different color.

"So what do you like... in sex?" she said the last part after I sat silent for a few seconds (although her looks provided enough context for her question, even for me. "The... Part... Where... I... Cum...", I said and I became silent again, realising that what I said sounded like a stupid joke, although I was actually trying to be serious. "OK, what's your favourite category of porn sites?" she asked, and when I began blushing she began encouraging me "Yes, tell me what are you thinking about right *now*?"

But I didn't, and so she took the lead and started describing a sexual fantasy of hers which I am not sure I remember clearly as it was it was pretty complex, but which began something like this: Anna/Dana wakes up at the seashore after taking a part of a ship wreck. She is naked, except for a bra (she had this whole story that justified this). Soon she is captured by a tribe of ingenious people who plan to use her as a sex slave, but she somehow realizes this and comes up with a counter plan - to seduce the members of the tribe and turn *them* into sex slaves instead. And via a long series of orgies, backstabbing and mindgames (although a little chaotic at times, her plot was probably more structured than the narrative you are reading right now) she becomes the princess of the tribe.

She got immerced within that fantasy for seconds and started teasing me and then making me grop her, constantly getting in and out of character. But the whole situation seemed funnier (and therefore much less weird) than I might have expected, maybe it was because it all reached the level of weirdness after which you couldn't expect anything.

Or perhaps it was that it is not our quirks that makes us weird, it's out inability to accept them and to show them to the world, perhaps it's the fear that we would be misunderstood. A fear which was, obviously, totally well- grounded, but also illogical, as we are *always* misunderstood, unless all we do is repeating stuff that someone else told us, (but even then we will probably mean it in a different way.)

It is this fear which actually is the sole reason why the very concept of the perverse exists. This fear of exposing yourself that makes you hide, betray, even remove this part of you which you actually hold dearest and that makes us make up explanations like "I went crazy for a while, this is not who am I, this is just a little deviation in my behaviour." Or, if you have a lot of free time, develop, like Anna, a split-personality disorder. 

This is what I thought first, but then while while I was sitting with her, trying out a fantasy of mine (my dream where my maths teacher has sex with me to reward me for my awesome work on the end-of-year test) the distinction between the perverse and the vanilla seemed to me superfluous, as did the distinction between alcohol and marijuanna which originally tempted me to try the latter. It seemed that it existed only so to provide ground for some people to feel bad, or rather for it was there for the opposite party to feel good.

And if not good, then at least protected. My memory shifted to several of my classmates who at ninth grade were already preparing for university exams and were starting to prepare their portfolio for when they apply at facebook or google (or for the more adventorous, when they create some startup.) - they were the biggest assholes ever, but nobody was able to say a thing about them as they had were carrying the establishment doctrines like an armour



It (the vanilla-perverse distinction) enabled some people to obscure the choices that they are making chose something and make it seem they made no choice. That they did it just because that's the way it is done in principle. To buy some comfort like how catholic priests were offering rich people eternal salvation for a few gold coins - lame, but if you already have the coins it's better than nothing.
