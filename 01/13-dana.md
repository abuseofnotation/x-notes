Perverted virgin

boredom/quantum entanglement

As I was talking, Anna finally sat closer to me and tried to establish some contact with me, but I blocked her. I tried to convince myself that I didn't care, although if I had known her in my normal life as my classmate or something, I would have probably hopelessly fallen in love with her and would have spent hours just selecting the books that I would "accidentally" drop when I pass near her at the corridor.
