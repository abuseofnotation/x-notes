Dana/


"Do you want to see Dana?" Ann she asked me after a while (Dana was the nickname she used for that dirty profile in that social network that she told me about) and then she explained what she meant - she liked to show me the sexy outfits that she had bought in order to take the pictures she posted online and to tell me some of the stories that she made up for her character.



I am maybe so drawn to my fantasies in my private time, simply because in the rest of the time I was fulfilling some other people's fantasies, I got used to it so much that that was all I did. Even with Cathy, I realise what everybody else does, that I am copying her in every aspect of her life, but it is not so much because I admire her, as they think, as it is because I want *her* to feel that there is someone who understands her, I want her to not feel alone."


And Anna was very good at this stuff, able to immerce herself in a fantasy for seconds and then to forget about it in an equally hastly manner, in order to jump to another one.



But there was no real issue with us sleeping together. Stupid thoughts like "but am I the person who is appropriate to be her first lover"
