The loneliness of the non-conformist

Irony/Comparing myself with Anna using war metaphors

When I say free of irony, I feel I need to elaborate, as I already mentioned Anna *was* ironic, however her irony was of type which was quite different from the emotion-numbing type you usually see in other people. It was an irony that had no concrete subject, nor an audience that was supposed to "get it" and laugh, a general irony, one which was targeted at everything with the purpose of being appreciated by everyone (although not many people actually did), one which seemed to perpetuate the natural asymmetry of the world and the general irrelevance of most of the things that we say and think. Her usage of this irony was so pervasive that it looked like the whole her individuality (the real one, not the clumsy imitation of Cathy that she presented to the world) existed solemnly within its bounds - her irony provided for her a safe place that enabled her individuality to flourish, but it was also a shield that guarded her from the rest of the world. In its realm, she could be really beautiful and confident and could walk naked and vulnerable without any fear of being hurt, but at the same time she was lonely, like a princess in a castle, spending some of the time secretly hoping that she would get kidnapped.

There was a concrete hand gesture, that Anna did all the time and which, I think embodied what I am talking about - it was a weird combination of a slapping movement (the movement when you make when you want somebody to stop something) and of hand-waving and she used it to express a feeling that was a combination of boredom ("yeah, yeah, we have heard about that already") and of supreme disinterest (like she wanted to say "There would be nothing you can possibly say about that that would in any way intrigue me") and whenever she thought a given topic or line of thought was not worthy of her attention, she just did that gesture and then just stopped listening to what I was saying until I changed the subject - it was something like a magical move, which made the thing that she didn't like disappear from her world, and made me disappear myself as a punishment for failing to recognize the nature of her magical abilities - I was still there and she was still with me, however after a while I felt that I was with Anna the impostor and that Anna the princess had banished me from the castle.

This ability of hers had always made me furious, as probably every peasant was furious at the aristocrats for being what they are and not simple and easy to understand like themselves (or indeed any person who saw people with more power than them), so I spent a lot of effort to make her more like me, make her face the unpleasant circumstances around us, even without accepting them, as acceptance was a quality that I myself didn't possess. In my mind I had thought that I would be doing her a favor by making her face her fears which I resembled the ones that I had at my childhood when I was afraid to go out of bed because some monsters will eat me (perhaps the "X" drawing on my door was some subconscious ritual that would protect me from them), but no - Anna was actually much more mature then what I thought and the fears that she had that made her negate everything were actually pretty real - she feared the people's hatred and intolerance, especially towards woman and minorities, groups both of which she represented. She feared "the Dull" as she called it, (which I maintain is not real but invented, but that doesn't make it any less scary) and that she would little by little be sucked into it - a very real possibility which would also turn out to be the fate of many of our friends, as the days went by. In many ways she was a realist and she wasn't so much in fear of those things, as she was foreseeing and mitigating the issues that they might have caused to her - when a war is coming, among the people who are getting ready to fight and those who are scared that they would have to, there would  always those some who had long fled out of the country, leaving everything behind them (under a fake name if needed) and were watching the action from the other part of the world from behind a pair of big sunglasses. None of them would go in history, but they also wouldn't have to participate in the absurd events that it was comprised of (if history weren't absurd, there wouldn't be a whole scientific discipline dedicated to deciphering how and why the hell did some events happen). 

I was the opposite: I was always fighting, although my bravery was phony - if I were a soldier, I wouldn't be like those truly brave ones who enter the battle with a devotion to die for their ideals - I probably would have been more akin to a guy those whose bravery, if it were present at all, is gone after the first gunshot, the one who is always looking back towards retreat and sometimes the only reason he is not heading to that direction is that he knows that they will likely shoot him as a deserter if he does so, while if he goes forward he would die as a hero which *seems* a little better. He would go into the battle, he might even be able to maintain concentration and do better than some soldiers who are truly brave due to his ability to detach himself when faced with a scary situation, but no matter how far he gets, all of them would know that his bravery is a result of cowardice - he is only advancing because he is too scared to escape.

Or perhaps the issue is that I didn't have anywhere to retreat *to*, that I stayed in the trenches, like for example many of my classmates who like me were able to retreat to mathematics when they were facing issues with some other aspect of their life, but who also, unlike me, were able to sink so deep into the subject that they would forget everything else in much the same way in which dedicated soldiers would sink into the idea of winning *their* war, whatever it was. Sometimes I think that that is why I disliked the nerd culture - it was because I wasn't a true nerd, but I wanted to be. Because I envied those people - in my mind they were always happier than me, as, even lonely, they were stepping in their own little realms with confidence, while myself no matter what choice did I make, would always be unsure about it, and I would always be looking forward to an opportunity to change it even for a second, not so much because I regretted the choice itself, but because I disliked *the fact that I have to make it*, the fact that I could only be at one place at one time, to be one person, leading one and only one life.

That (the inherent limitation of choice) was something which Anna realized too, and because of which she never attempted to escape from her escapism - she knew very well that the real was not the ideal and so, even though she sometimes flirted with reality, whenever she never got too close to anything real she just made it disappear using this gesture of hers which I already talked about.
