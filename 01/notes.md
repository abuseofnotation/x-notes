she also forgave me for bringing them up, and waited very patiently for me to correct my mistakes like a strict teacher who nevertheless really likes for their students to succeed, and she kept guiding me towards the direction she wanted me to head towards, which interestingly was the complete opposite of the one I thought that I should go - I figured that what we should be doing some bonding, you know, sharing our life stories and finding some common ground between us through them, really she seemed to want to escape from the aforementioned stories like from a bad dream, and she absolutely didn't want me to have anything to do with them. She didn't want me in her castle, neither she wanted to get to mine (weird methaphor, but bear with me), but wanted us both to stay outside of ourselves, with our conversations roaming freely from subject to subject without being restrained by our personas.

However, that was harder than I thought, as there were only as much that you can say about a given subject without going to the realm of the personal, and moreover our (at least mine) attempts to escape from ourselves had this weird quality that, the more you concentrate on being objective and detached, the more revealing you actually can be to the trained eye, for example, I feel that a person who has heard me talk about math knows more about me than any person with whom I just had some mundane conversations. That must have something to do with the fact that each system of knowledge is based on some self-evident postulates, and so the more fundamental an assertion is, the closer it is to a postulate i.e. by saying things that we find self-evident we actually expose our core beliefs (and we get nose bleeds). If you talk with me about math, I would tell you that we have to remain optimistic about finding the solution about such and such problem, that computer-generated proofs are a good technology, but they take away the human aspect from the discipline which still should be central to the discipline. And then I'd start telling you about some ideas that I had the previous day. 

Still, as I hinted to Ann, it was also better than the *reverse* kind of envy, which I had noticed that many people have, as it didn't force us to do stupid shit just to attain some made up object of desire. It was demotivating, but it was also peacefull, it left us disillusioned, but at least we weren't wasting our time pursuing illusions that were nothing but a facade behind which was the "same ol' shit" that we knew and hated. 



I was worried whether I sounded authentic, although what does authenticity even mean when it comes to personalities - we all basically say and do things that we have seen somewhere and then we stick with them if they bring us good results. Perhaps authenticity depends on how important results are for us and to what extend they define our behaviour? That seemed crucial, at least, speaking for myself, I am positive that the importance placed on results was certainly a huge factor for the forming of my personality at school where everyone were obsessed by results, so much so that I sometimes felt that nobody there actually carred about math and that the fact that we were doing math (and not physics, philosophy art etc.) was of secondary importance - the modus operanti of our school could have been the same with any other discipline, and we ourselves (the students) would have been exactly the same people. At that moment, this idea made me sad - we had spent numerous years at perfecting something that we never learned to care about in the first place (although I did and still do care about math). 

"You would be surprised, but I actually *want* to fall. I *want* to get hurt. Without hurt, your body loses contact with the environment and you become lame."

"It is all very limiting. Reality is limiting, living is like participating in a race that there is no way for you to win, but at the same time you have to participate in."



And when we (me and Anna) eventually started kissing we did it out of boredom, or at least *I* think that this is why we did it, although I can say the same thing for most things that I do. Her expression was serious as she removed her sweater, as was mine I hope, although it didn't really matter even if it was goofy, as for some reason I didn't really care how I looked to her. Which was weird - if I had known her in my normal life as my classmate or something, I would have probably hopelessly fallen in love with her and would have spent hours just selecting the books that I would "accidentally" drop when I pass near her at the corridor. But at that night when I was already in her bedroom, her lust seemed for me dull, even appauling. The added complexity coming from the dialogues that we had before made her persona too loaded for me to perceive her as just a sex object and my lack of confidence prevented me from turning myself on from her as a real person, with thoughts like "am I fit to be this girl's first lover" rushing down my head and then my brain replaying various memories from my previous (failed) relationships I felt our world (the one me and Dana created) being collapsing into the real one. I wanted to make it stop (I was not sure whether I should do it, but I didn't want for my insecurities to interfere with my decision).



Some people like blond girls, I like you.


I am maybe so drawn to my fantasies in my private time, simply because in the rest of the time I was fulfilling some other people's fantasies, I got used to it so much that that was all I did. Even with Cathy, I realise what everybody else does, that I am copying her in every aspect of her life, but it is not so much because I admire her, as they think, as it is because I want *her* to feel that there is someone who understands her, I want her to not feel alone."


And Anna was very good at this stuff, able to immerce herself in a fantasy for seconds and then to forget about it in an equally hastly manner, in order to jump to another one.


At that point I came across a distinction between me and Alex, that I thought was interesting- that I had spend my life falling in love with women, while he spent it fucking them. 



Cathy's tactic was that she never ever tried to reconcile the real and the ideal and be pragmatic instead, i.e. concentrating on the sexual aspect of love, as opposed to searching for its meaning, and in school as I mentioned, she were concentrating on giving the teachers what they wanted, instead of trying to understand the disciplines better than they did, which, kids, is never a good idea if your aim is good grades. So she basically scraped the ideal in order to get closer to it.
