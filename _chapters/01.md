Alex, Church and Turing, being stupid, 

"Call me Alex!", he said that while standing up just next to the bed he was probably occupying naked from the waist up, and smiling with a childish smile. I thought he was over-friendly, but his voice was so loud and firm, that I could not think of an appropriate semi-sarcastic response which I could use to distance myself from him, without being rude ("OK", "If you insist", etc.), so I just shook his hand and started a regular conversation, asking him how old he was, for how long had he been staying there etc. but to my surprise, although still very friendly, he wasn't at all eager to answer my questions, and it even seemed that some of them he did not know the answers of. So unusual were his reactions that for the first few days I had the suspicion that he might be "really insane" - a fact which understandably made me uncomfortable, especially since, given the fact that both of us were under the same circumstances, such categorizations were far from objective. My mind could help but think that probably *I* was insane and he was the normal one, and he seemed insane to me thus.

Alex had a huge scar on his left knee which I noticed immediately when I saw him and which made me want to immediately distance myself from him even more. An urge which did not dissolve even after I learned that he got it in a trivial way (sports incident) and was even strengthened by my realization that it weren't the scar, nor his cheerfulness which crept me out, it was his hair, the way he wanted to shake hands, and all the other numerous ways in which he looked just like me. 

"So what do you do for fun?" I asked, consciously trying to distance myself from him by emphasizing our differences by talking about my weird hobbies which I was sure would be to him most alien, "I like to read". But he just gave me a thumbs up and changed the subject leaving me with no choice but to make friends with him. I usually pick my friends very carefully, never approaching them until they have passed some of my elaborate mental tests, like imagining them in hard situations and seeing how would they escape from them, or, perhaps more importantly, imagining us hanging out together and assessing if we look cool enough. It was true that recently I started abandoning this practice, but that was not because I didn't want for my friends to conform to my criteria, rather it was because I just started realizing that I was too bad at judging the people around me for me to provide a decent enough assessment. But that kind of reasoning clearly wasn't valid for Alex's, as he was clearly not a person whom I could interest in any of my hobbies, science, hard nor soft, and neither with any of my other interests, which meant that although he seemed accepting, he could not be a person who can be anything more than my roommate.


"And who are you?" Alex's voice was so loud that it somehow got into my head and made me replay all kinds of memories that I thought identified my personality, like my acceptance in the Sofia Mathematics College (where I have been studying for the past few years), and also things that I wanted to forget but could not, like my first poor mark which I got shortly after my admission in the same school, which was the first time I tasted marijuana. I don't know why, but I couldn't get rid of that memory, although the occasion was completely uneventful. Perhaps it was because of my obsession to always have control over my behavior and, if possible, over everything around me. And then I though, maybe it was this obsession, and not my obsession with mathematics, which was the defining characteristic of my personality. Perhaps if Alex were indeed interested in who am I, I would have to tell him that story and how terrible I felt then. It was not the fact that I was high that unnerved me - it was the fact that I could not stop being high on command and transition to whatever state I wanted to be in a given moment - that is what I would have told Alex if he was really interested in me, but he of course wasn't - he just wanted to know my name, and as for the fact that I was a control freak, seeing the way he was looking at me he, had probably already gotten it by then.

"Sorry, I am a bit of a dork" I said trying to apologize for not responding to his very simple request, while at the same time spicing up my persona with some self-irony. "It's OK, me too" he responded softly. Although I was almost sure that he was doing it just to make me feel good, his response actually offended me in several ways: firstly because he chose to take what I said literary, as opposed to the joke which it partly was and secondly because he chose to agree with it instead of trying to convince me that I was wrong. And the fact that he assumed the dork identity actually made it worse, as it looked like he was doing it just because he pitied me, which was the last thing that I needed. 

Had he been a real dork, his gesture would have been gladly accepted by me, only he actually seemed like the exact opposite - one only needed to see the way he stood up - calm, fearless, not feeling a single bit of shame over his naked body (in which there also wasn't anything to be ashamed about) to see that any of my issues such as the ones I mentioned above would for him be most alien. He seemed to me like a person who, for example, when rejected by a girl whom he wanted to date would, not feel less crushed and more surprised by the occurrence of so unlikely an event. 

This was the way I perceived Alex, although I was sure that this wasn't the whole truth especially since he was here with me - to him maybe his issues were serious, just as my issues were serious for me. 

Had we been able to switch places for some time, we both would have probably been able to realize that and live the rest of our lives care-free, not needing any kind of therapy. This thought were, for some time, so vivid that made me want to actually switch places with him and not only figuratively - I had to become as strong as him, and as confident as him and to adopt his character, only so I can then better appreciate my own character to which I would go back to after a couple of months - a process which, I imagined, would cure me from all kinds of anxiety forever. Only after I spoke with Alex for a couple of hours had I realized that it was very hard to do - his personality was becoming even more illogical for me with every new piece of information I was learning about him, his decision to make friends with me being the most illogical of them all.

"You want to meet with my girlfriend and her friends?" he asked me while I was looking at my opened suitcase. I pointed at my luggage and smiled half-jokingly laughing at him. Of course I did not want to go anywhere, I had just arrived and I have work to do. I smiled for a few seconds more, but he just smiled back and continued talking about his girlfriend (she was coming from a rich family, she was always looking very sexy, even in her uniform etc.) with a smile on his face and I started imagining that he was actually laughing back at me, thinking something like "What kind of loser would spend his evening tidying up his clothes, where there are so much more interesting things to do". It was as if his whole posture was dictating these words to me and one had to just find a systematic way to analyze it in order to spell them out. And so I said "OK" and I went out with him.

We leave the room and turn walk in the direction opposite to the one from which I came, going through a big corridor which resembles the one from my school where the classrooms are. I hear all kinds of sounds coming from the direction where we are headed - footsteps, music, and also numerous different voices, all shouting and having conversations. I panic as I realize that I am about to make my first "public appearance" to the people in the facility. I try to calm myself by saying to myself with a smug voice (which is, for some reason, the way I usually talk to myself) that I most likely surpass those people in any respect conceivable, and so all I have to do to make a good impression is to act natural, only to realize that I don't even know what it means to act natural in this facility, and I hardly got any clues from my encounter with Alex. I try glancing at him, and trying to see the expression he would adopt before entering, only to realize that he is already a few steps in front of me and going so fast that I almost have to run just to keep up with his pace, and observing the difference between the way we move reminds me of the even bigger difference between the way we are seen by the others makes it apparent that sticking with him is not a good strategy. So what, should I act to the people here in the same way as I act to my classmates? The question reminds me that the way in which classmates usually act towards each other is much different from the way they do it at my school - I study in a very prestigious school, so the spirit that dictates our actions is that of competitiveness - it is all about who knows more and who can do more in a framework that is almost as rigorously-defined as the subject matter which it puts to the test. In other words, my behavior was always based on a precise set of goals, something which I am sure I won't see here, except if just "getting better" counted as a goal, and it most definitely could not (if I had time I would have spent a few seconds just to appreciate the irony of the fact that letting myself slip, for just a few hours, from the very strict environment that I have placed into when I was admitted at my school, has put me into an environment that, as far as I could see, contained no rules whatsoever. But maybe it was just me being too quick to judge).

As we get closer to the door I start seeing the people in the hallway. The way they act resembles the one in *a* school, but it definitely is unlike *my* school, where everyone just sits there and rest on their shoulders because they are tired, or alternatively talk if not to about the things we study, about computer games or problems that are probably formally equivalent to the things we study. I continue talking, considering the different ways in which I can act - should I walk with Alex and meet his friends first, which was what I was set out to do originally, or should I take some time to wander through the hallway to look around and be like "Sorry, I just want to hang around for a sec, it's OK, if you don't wish to wait for me then, maybe we can meet after". Should I quickly find my crowd (or the one that resembles it most) and ditch everyone else, or should I try to make my best to find unlikely friendships with Alex's circle? Without me noticing, this dilemma has become a *leitmotif* of my life: should I be more like Allan Turing - passionate, giving a voice to my ideas, as weird as they can be, and live a life with a lot of ups and downs, or like Alonzo Church - pragmatic and disciplined and always following a strict plan. You could observe how both approaches worked for both of those people by studying their biographies (Turing slept around with younger men and got into huge trouble about it, and ultimately killed himself / nothing really notable about Church's life), but for me, it is much more important to consider how they influenced their work, In fact this is why I picked exactly those two people who, if you don't know, where the first to devise formal models capturing the concepts of an "alghorithm" and "computation". Look into Turing Machine - a weird, you might say convoluted model and try to compare them with the Alonzo's solution, as simple and elegant as the symbol, (the only symbol!) that contains its gist - the Greek letter lambda. True, Alonzo was much more spot on, nailing the concept of computation without any kind of ceremony, but Turing Machines - they answer the question they are set out to answer, but also answer, and raise, so many other questions that they change the direction that the whole field took. But although I am always eager to apply it, that whole Church/Turing dichotomy was never of much use for my life - beside the fact that I cannot decide who's side I am on (Turing machines are cooler, but at the same time I lean towards Church simply, because his life was more stress-free) I always seem to be put in situations where neither approach seems feasible, like right now following Alex would be Turingy, because I would be meeting people who I wouldn't normally meet, but at the same time abandoning Alex would be Turingy, as well, him being the only (friendly) person I know. In short, I often realize that I am thinking in a given way just for the sake of thinking in this way - maybe it is not the choice I make between Church and Turing, but the dichotomy between them itself that defines my life. It (the dichotomy) certainly defined the way I acted as we reached the room and the first impressions that I made to the people there - a few moments after we entered I realized that there were some people staring at me, while I was still contemplating how should I behave, gazing at the ceiling like a complete idiot. Still I wasn't *certain* I looked stupid - I was like any other person who sees everyone being stupid and ridiculous all the time and has the sneaking suspicion that they too, conversely, are sometimes stupid, but are never really sure of it with their heart although the data no doubt shows it to be the case. As if me being stupid was something that is highly unlikely, like those events in American movies where they always say "Impossible!" and then "I check the calculations three times!", before they realize what we as spectators already know from the trailer (meteors, zombies, aliens etc) and even in those situations people end up believing, whereas nobody really believes they are stupid, except if they think that the way that they are being stupid is not stupid to them.

The reason we abstain from looking stupid (I devised that theory in this very second) the fact that we just thrust other people's judgment and don't think too highly of ourselves. Therefore the people with the highest self esteem were the most ridiculous ones.
