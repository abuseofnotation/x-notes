Well, I'll be damned. I guess there really is no way for me to continue this, without doing this annoying thing where the author stops the story (which has barely started anyways) just to start blabbering about their childhood, just like arcane authors, who at least had the courtesy to do this *at the beginning* of their books.

But I could not start this note with by telling you about my childhood and such, for two reasons:

1. I mean, it's sooo cliche (indeed, I could not even think of a place where I saw it, which proves that it is one of these things that are so cliche, that you cannot even identify where you know it from . Yes, this is just a suicide note, but I still do have my standards.

2. I like to make it slightly more interesting, by juxaposing my story with the stories of some other characters, which you would already know from the first part.
