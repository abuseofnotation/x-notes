I was worried whether I sounded authentic, although what does authenticity even mean when it comes to personalities - we all basically say and do things that we have seen somewhere and then we stick with them if they bring us good results. Perhaps authenticity depends on how important results are for us and to what extend they define our behaviour? That seemed crucial, at least, speaking for myself, I am positive that the importance placed on results was certainly a huge factor for the forming of my personality at school where everyone were obsessed by results, so much so that I sometimes felt that nobody there actually carred about math and that the fact that we were doing math (and not physics, philosophy art etc.) was of secondary importance - the modus operanti of our school could have been the same with any other discipline, and we ourselves (the students) would have been exactly the same people. At that moment, this idea made me sad - we had spent numerous years at perfecting something that we never learned to care about in the first place (although I did and still do care about math).
