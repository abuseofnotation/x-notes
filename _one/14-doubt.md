Soon we heard a knock on the window - Cathy was at our terrace smoking cigarettes and she already had a half-full ashtray in front of her. Anna, who was already wearing her normal clothes again, opened the door and let her in, and as soon as she entered she started talking, retelling us some news report that she had read about how the leader of some pseudo-nazi party is gaining more and more followers and how they (I didn't know if they were a man or a woman) might have a very good result at the next election. She seemed sad at first, but she quickly got back to her normal self (the one I knew from a few hours ago) as Anna was listening to her and encouraging her to tell us more.

 <span class="voice-cathy">"Oh, but you are just doing it to cheer me up,"</span> Cathy said, when she saw my featureless expression which reminded her that, like me, Ann had zero interest in politics and the like,  <span class="voice-cathy">"let's talk about something else!"</span> And she immediately began a second topic telling us about how her evening with Alex went. It turned out that Alex was so tired from climbing that mountain that he fell asleep after a really short sex session and she couldn't wake him up any more, even even after she touched him and turned on the TV. 

 <span class="voice-maxim">"Sounds like you had much fun though?"</span> I muttered and then went on to explain that we heard some noises, but Cathy just laughed. <span class="voice-cathy">"Oh, that..." </span> she said and then explained to me that she barely made any sound when they were actually having sex, so what we heard heard were most probably were hearing the sounds of her masturbating next to her sleeping boyfriend.

 <span class="voice-cathy">"That basstard, he always does that"</span> she continued. And then me or Ann asked her. I immediately asked if she meant that he always cums and falls asleep after a minute, but she shook her head <span class="voice-cathy"> "No, it's not that he is bad at it, he just always does not more, nor less than exactly what he wants."</span>

 <span class="voice-anna"> "Well, you didn't seem like you needed anything more, girl"</span> Anna retorted immediately in a way that seemed envious, which prompted Cathy to start a long monologue on the topic of sex and masturbation, which I don't remember very well (something about the two being connected, like you cannot have good sex without being good at masturbating, or something like that.) <span class="voice-cathy">"It's important to have fun,"</span> She concluded. <span class="voice-cathy">"But you must put some work into it, not just expect it to happen by itself."</span>.

Then Cathy started asking how our evening went and Ann tried to retell some highlights while carefully trying not to say anything about me, although I didn't care that much. At some point I even remembered how I told Ann that the best part I like most about sex was the part I cum, and then I actually came before having sex and I though about telling the whole story to Cathy, but I figured that the buildup was too long and it was not worth it, so I just kept laughing by myself. 

 <span class="voice-cathy">"Well, you looks like you had a lot of fun, even if you didn't have sex." </span> Cathy said when




Maybe I was so drawn to my fantasies in my private time, simply because in the rest of the time I was fulfilling other people's fantasies, I got used to it so much that that was all I did. Even with Cathy, I realise, like everybody else does, that I am copying her in every aspect of her life, but it is not so much because I admire her, as they think, as it is because I want *her* to feel that there is someone who understands her, I want her to not feel alone."

But how is that possible, that we cannot get away? Maybe we are just mistaking what quitting means, thinking that we are escaping when we are actually just walking the same old road, removing everything else but that which is our problem. Because the problem is our blind spot. Because we identify this problem with ourselves.
