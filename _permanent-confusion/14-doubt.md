Alex's good night sleep / Sex and love / 

Soon we heard a knock on the window - Cathy was at our terrace smoking cigarettes and she already had a half-full ashtray in front of her. Anna, who was already wearing her normal clothes again, opened the door and let her in, and as soon as she entered she started talking, retelling us some news report that she had read about how the leader of some pseudo-nazi party is gaining more and more followers and how they (I didn't know if they were a man or a woman) might have a very good result at the next election. She seemed sad at first, but she quickly got back to her normal self (the one I knew from a few hours ago) as Anna was listening to her and encouraging her to tell us more.

 <span class="voice-cathy">"Oh, but you are just doing it to cheer me up,"</span> Cathy said, when she saw my featureless expression which reminded her that, like me, Ann had zero interest in politics and the like,  <span class="voice-cathy">"let's talk about something else!"</span> And she immediately began a second topic telling us about how her evening with Alex went. It turned out that Alex was so tired from climbing that mountain that he fell asleep after a really short sex session and she couldn't wake him up any more, even even after she touched him and turned on the TV. 

 <span class="voice-maxim">"Sounds like you had much fun though?"</span> I muttered and then went on to explain that we heard some noises, but Cathy just laughed. <span class="voice-cathy">"Oh, that..." </span> she said and then explained to me that she barely made any sound when they were actually having sex, so what we heard heard were most probably were hearing the sounds of her masturbating next to her sleeping boyfriend.

 <span class="voice-cathy">"That basstard, he always does that"</span> she continued. And then me or Ann asked her. I immediately asked if she meant that he always cums and falls asleep after a minute, but she shook her head <span class="voice-cathy"> "No, it's not that he is bad at it, he just always does not more, nor less than exactly what he wants."</span>

 <span class="voice-anna"> "Well, you didn't seem like you needed anything more, girl"</span> Anna retorted immediately in a way that seemed envious, which prompted Cathy to start a long monologue on the topic of sex and masturbation, which I don't remember very well (something about the two being connected, like you cannot have good sex without being good at masturbating, or something like that.) I remember how she ended it: <span class="voice-cathy">"It's important to have fun. But you must put some work into it, not just expect it to happen by itself."</span>.

Then Cathy started asking how our evening went and Ann tried to retell some highlights while carefully trying not to say anything about me, although I didn't care that much. At some point I even started laughing at the fact that I told Ann that the best part I like most about sex was the part I cum, and then I came before actually having sex with her. <span class="voice-cathy">"Well, you looks like you had a lot more fun than us, even if you didn't have sex." </span> Cathy said pointing at me, as eventhough I didn't tell the "joke", I still couldn't supress my laughter. Hearing her say this made all my previous thoughts about the parallel between me and Alex enter my mind again, as if all this time they were waiting at the back of my mind like soldiers, preparing for a surprise raid. In particular, I thought how I had spend my life falling in love with girls, while he seemed to have spent his time just fucking them (and falling asleep, at this particular instance (which was something that I myself was better off doing at that moment, but my brain couldn't stop.)) i.e. I spent it *seeking* things, (while while he spent it *finding* them. 

The first person I fell in love with was one that I met online, who was living in another city. I never met her, although arranging it was not strictly impossible. Nothing in real-life connected us, and she barely knew how I looked like, but she said she loved me and it felt great, even greater than hearing it from someone I knew, plus she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry that I have ever heard, especially from a 14-year-old. I remember this particular line which is probably rellevant to the topic:

> OK, I agree.
> Probably it's better for me to suffer
> from feelings pure and love that leaves you without words
> Than it is, for the lonely soul to count
> it's parners, boring and perverse.

(It sounded better in Bulgarian, I cannot really translate poetry, sorry.)

If Alex, was in a similar situation, he would drive directly to her town as, unlike me, he was pursuing a clear and obtainable goal, which is a prerequisite fo achieving something, but also a way to limit what you can achieve. Upon realising that, after spending a whole evening being jealous of him, I started to suddenly feel sad for Alex. For although unfulfilled, my dreams suddenly started seeming way more exciting that anything that he can experience, either by dreaming or doing. And my world - immensely richer.
