Alex's good night sleep / girls that I have fallen in love with

Soon we heard a knock on the window - Cathy was at our terrace smoking cigarettes and she already had a half-full ashtray in front of her. Anna, who was already wearing her normal clothes again, opened the door and let her in, and as soon as she entered she started talking, retelling us some news report that she had read about how the leader of some pseudo-nazi party is gaining more and more followers and how they (I didn't know if they were a man or a woman) might have a very good result at the next election. She seemed sad at first, but she quickly got back to her normal self (the one I knew from a few hours ago) as Anna was listening to her and encouraging her to tell us more.

 <span class="voice-cathy">"Oh, but you are just doing it to cheer me up,"</span> Cathy said, when she saw my featureless expression which reminded her that, like me, Ann had zero interest in politics and the like,  <span class="voice-cathy">"let's talk about something else!"</span> And she immediately began a second topic telling us about how her evening with Alex went. It turned out that Alex was so tired from climbing that mountain that he fell asleep after a really short sex session and she couldn't wake him up any more, even even after she touched him and turned on the TV. 

 <span class="voice-maxim">"Sounds like you had much fun though?"</span> I muttered and then went on to explain that we heard some noises, but Cathy just laughed. <span class="voice-cathy">"Oh, that..." </span> she said and then explained to me that she barely made any sound when they were actually having sex, so what we heard heard were most probably were hearing the sounds of her masturbating next to her sleeping boyfriend.

 <span class="voice-cathy">"That basstard, he always does that"</span> she continued. And then me or Ann asked her. I immediately asked if she meant that he always cums and falls asleep after a minute, but she shook her head <span class="voice-cathy"> "No, it's not that he is bad at it, he just always does not more, nor less than exactly what he wants."</span>

 <span class="voice-anna"> "Well, you didn't seem like you needed anything more, girl"</span> Anna retorted immediately in a way that seemed envious, which prompted Cathy to start a long monologue on the topic of sex and masturbation, which I don't remember very well (something about the two being connected, like you cannot have good sex without being good at masturbating, or something like that.) <span class="voice-cathy">"It's important to have fun,"</span> She concluded. <span class="voice-cathy">"But you must put some work into it, not just expect it to happen by itself."</span>.

Then Cathy started asking how our evening went and Ann tried to retell some highlights while carefully trying not to say anything about me, although I didn't care that much. At some point I even remembered how I told Ann that the best part I like most about sex was the part I cum, and then I came before actually having sex and I though about telling the whole story to Cathy, but I figured that the buildup was too long and it was not worth it.

 <span class="voice-cathy">"Well, you looks like you had a lot more fun than us, even if you didn't have sex." </span> Cathy said pointing at me, as even though I didn't tell the "joke", I still couldn't supress my laughter, but her line turned my mood on 180 degrees, not on the happy/sad vector, but on the vector which was even harder to shift - the one that governs how concentrated you are.

This was because somehow this line made all my previous thoughts about the parellel between me and Alex enter my mind again, and do so in a way that was very invasive at that, as if all this time they were waiting at the back of my mind, hidden, like soldiers, preparing a massive surprise raid. 

But the one thought that occupied my mind so completely (as, there is alwaysthat one though, at least for me) was a particular distinction between me and Alex, that I thought was interesting - that I had spend my life falling in love with women, while he seemed to have spent his time just fucking them (and falling asleep, at this particular instance (which was something that I myself was better off doing at that moment, but, if you think about it, this was again because of love.))

The first person I fell in love with was one that I met online, who was living in another city. I never met her, although arranging it was not strictly impossible, but she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry that I have ever heard, especially from a 14-year-old. I remember this particular line which is probably rellevant to the topic:

> OK, I agree.
> Probably it's better for me to suffer
> from feelings pure and love that leaves you without words
> Than it is, for the lonely soul to count
> it's parners, boring and perverse.

(It sounded better in Bulgarian, I cannot really translate poetry, sorry.)

The second person I fell in love with... well, we again didn't have any sex, but that was clearly for the better, although at the time it looked as a fate worse than dead (she was into me and I made a lot of effort to make her feel good, but she didn't actually want us to have a serious relationship.) 

The third one, I think I we already had sex, but she dumped me the next day which triggered a huge period of depression. 

The forth one, I had sex some more times, but it eventually became boring, a fact which was, sadly, a catalyst for an end of our relationship, which didn't stop me from continuing loving her, probably even to this day.

Alex, had had sex with a girl before I even considered that I can have sex -it was short and funny, but he laughted, as he considered it a training as opposed to a failure to do something (because unlike me he was used to failing.) 

If Alex, would have met the second girl I fell in love with, he would have  a one-night stand with her, in which he wouldn't finish reading her poetry. It would have saved him a lot of trouble and there are definitely times in which I would have loved to be at his place, but he would have missed  "feelings pure and love that leaves you without words". 

There were occasions where Alex would, as myself get very invested in a relationship, but nevertheless there was one huge difference between my and Alex's relationships - namely that unlike me, he was pursuing a clear and obtainable goal. Which is a prerequisite fo achieving something, but (I realized that at that moment) also a way to what you can achieve. 

At that moment, after spending a whole evening being jealous of him, I started to suddenly feel pity Alex for although unfulfilled, my dreams suddenly started seeming way more exciting that anything that he can do, even in real life. Our relationship, although weird, seemed immensely richer than theirs.

She was so drawn to her fantasies in her private time, simply because in the rest of the time she was fulfilling other people's fantasies.

I was so drawn to my fantasies in my private time, simply because in the rest of the time I was fulfilling other people's fantasies. I got used to it so much that that was all I did. Even with Cathy, I realise, like everybody else does, that I am copying her in every aspect of her life, but it is not so much because I admire her, as they think, as it is because I want *her* to feel that there is someone who understands her, I want her to not feel alone."

But how is that possible, that we cannot get away? Maybe we are just mistaking what quitting means, thinking that we are escaping when we are actually just walking the same old road, removing everything else but that which is our problem. Because the problem is our blind spot. Because we identify this problem with ourselves.
