Then I look at my notes on the Knapsack problem which were laying there and with my reversed judgment I instantly realized that there was no solution for it, that P and NP were just two unrelated classes of problems, that the connection between them was made up. My shift was so complete that the people who thought that there was a reason why P would be in NP all seemed like a bunch of self-important weirdos, and their pursuit of the proof - like an unhealthy obsession.

Whenever you study mathematics, as in real life, you came across those very weird and convoluted structures that are beyond any kind of explanation - you have the fractals like the Mandelbrot set, that is a result set of a super simple equation but looks totally out of this world, you had the continuous processes that work in a way that is totally inexplicable to me, the NP problems, the motherfucking monster group (for which John Conway said that it's his only wish to "know what it is about"). But no, most people who study maths would either ignore most of those or dismiss them as uninteresting, or alternatively obsess over one of them, forcefully trying to fit it in their invented structure, like so many people tried to fit NP into P. 

Thinking about all this, I wrote a proof that P does not equal NP, which I thought was correct, but which did not resemble any of the mathematical proofs that I have seen (with the possible exception of Turing's "On computable numbers..." (the one where he introduced the Turing machine in order to prove that some mathematical problems are undecidable.)) but instead looked more like an essay. I will sketch the proof in the remainder of this chapter. 

It started with an idea in logic. The idea that, when they are reduced to logic, mathematical truths (as well as all other absolute truths) are *tautologies* i.e. they are just repetitions of things that are already given (axioms, postulates etc.) i.e. all mathematical truths are basically a very convoluted formulations of the statement *A = A*. 

An important corollary of this which may surprise some people, while at the same time being completely obvious to others is that mathematical propositions *don't say anything about the real world*. So, for example when you say that something like *1 + 1 = 2* is true, you are not asserting a fact about some real objects (apples oranges, etc.), you are merely simply saying that the terms *1 + 1* and *2* are defined in such a way that they can be used interchangeably.

So, let's see what the proof of P=NP would look like when involve when we take this idea as a premise.  then proving that P = NP would involve reformulating the statement " The solution of Problem A can be check for correctness in n iterations" to "Problem A can be solved in n iterations" My paper used that point as a premise and went on to prove that such reformulation is impossible.
