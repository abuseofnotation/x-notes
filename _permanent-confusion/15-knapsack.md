In the following days, Anna discarded all my attempts to establish any kind of connection with her. At that time I thought that she had decided that she didn't like me and that this was her way of showing me that she didn't want to be in a relatioship with me, or, what I hoped for, that she liked me so much that she got afraid of the emotional commitment that our first date entailed, but later I learned that the reality of it was (as I would probably could have realized right away, if I wasn't so damn self-centered) that she

And as I was thinking about whether this paper would get accepted in a journal and being afraid that it wouldn't my sight shifted to the bed where Anna was sleeping and, I suddenly felt better. Better than I felt the last week, month or year. In fact, better that ever. And then it occurred to me that, paradoxically, my stay in the facility worked pretty well. That if I continue doing this I would be OK. I could not remove my self-doubt (and neither I wanted to), and the dreadful feeling that my life and everything I can possibly say or do was not worth anything, but if I tried to, I felt that I could lessen the feeling of pretense that was causing this self-doubt. After all, why a person would even bother to feel self-doubt if they didn't take themselves too seriously in the first place? We only doubt the things that we rely on, and that is clearly not so because there is no reason for us to doubt the rest, it is just that most of the time we could not be bothered with doing so. Is the practice of taking ourselves so seriously just a survival mechanism, a way not to float away from the "sane" world? If so, then Anna's ironic gesture was probably the best reaction to everything that I did in the last year (although she herself was one hundred percent the same as me), I was confident that I was brilliant, or at least that I *would* be brilliant one day, but I was no more brilliant than a person who attempts to build a house in a swamp and thinks that the reason other people missed the lovely spot was their superior perceptions and judgment (or that guy Icarus from the Greek myth who flew too close to the sun and fell, if you are looking for a more (over)poetic metaphor). 

At any rate, I was guilty about everything in my life, the good and the bad stuff, myself. I felt that realizing that was a good start towards my rehabilitation.
